 ## Flask Application Design for a Multi-Page Web App with Login, Register, and Profile Management

### HTML Files

#### 1. `index.html` (Home Page)
- This is the main page of the application.
- It contains links to the login, register, and profile pages.

#### 2. `login.html` (Login Page)
- This page contains a form for users to enter their login credentials.
- It also has a link to the register page.

#### 3. `register.html` (Register Page)
- This page contains a form for users to create a new account.
- It also has a link to the login page.

#### 4. `profile.html` (Profile Page)
- This page displays the user's profile information, such as their name, email, and profile picture.
- It also contains links to edit the user's profile and log out.

### Routes

#### 1. `@app.route('/')` (Home Page)
- This route displays the `index.html` page.

#### 2. `@app.route('/login')` (Login Page)
- This route displays the `login.html` page.

#### 3. `@app.route('/register')` (Register Page)
- This route displays the `register.html` page.

#### 4. `@app.route('/profile')` (Profile Page)
- This route displays the `profile.html` page.

#### 5. `@app.route('/login_handler')` (Login Handler)
- This route handles the login form submission.
- It checks if the user's credentials are valid and redirects them to the profile page if they are.
- If the credentials are invalid, it displays an error message on the login page.

#### 6. `@app.route('/register_handler')` (Register Handler)
- This route handles the registration form submission.
- It creates a new user account and redirects them to the profile page.
- If there is an error creating the account, it displays an error message on the register page.

#### 7. `@app.route('/logout')` (Logout Handler)
- This route logs the user out and redirects them to the home page.

### Additional Considerations

- The application will use a database to store user information.
- The application will use a session management mechanism to keep track of logged-in users.
- The application will use a secure password hashing mechanism to protect user passwords.
